- **API Gateway**: RESTful API endpoints with proper authentication
- **DynamoDB**: NoSQL database with user-scoped data partitioning
- **Cognito**: User authentication and authorization
- **S3**: File storage for resumes and documents

### **Frontend (React Web)**
- **React 18**: Modern React with hooks and functional components
- **AWS Amplify**: Authentication, API integration, and hosting
- **Material-UI**: Consistent design system and components
- **React Router**: Client-side routing and navigation

### **Mobile (React Native)**
- **React Native**: Cross-platform iOS and Android support
- **AWS Amplify**: Native authentication and API integration
- **React Navigation**: Native navigation with stack and tab patterns
- **Platform-specific UI**: Native components for optimal UX
- **Offline-first DataStore**: Local queueing, sync banners, and conflict resolution for critical data

### **Shared Utilities**
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed interfaces and utilities
- **Common Logic**: Reusable business logic across platforms
- **Logger**: Structured logging utility with JSON formatting
- **ErrorHandler**: Consistent error response formatting
- **RequestHandler**: Input validation and request processing
- **DynamoDBUtil**: Database operations with circuit breaker protection

### **Data Models**

The platform uses four primary data models with user-scoped partitioning:

- **Users**: Profile information, authentication data
- **Jobs**: Job postings with company, location, salary details
- **Experiences**: Work history, skills, education (partitioned by userId)
- **Applications**: Job applications with status tracking (partitioned by userId)

### **Security & Secrets Management**

The platform implements enterprise-grade security practices:

- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Sensitive credentials and API keys
- **SSM Parameter Store**: Configuration parameters with encryption
- **IAM Roles**: Least-privilege access for Lambda functions
- **DynamoDB Encryption**: Server-side encryption for all data
- **HTTPS Only**: All API endpoints secured with TLS

Secrets are managed through automated scripts in [`scripts/setup-secrets.sh`](scripts/setup-secrets.sh). See [`SECRETS-README.md`](SECRETS-README.md) for detailed setup instructions.
